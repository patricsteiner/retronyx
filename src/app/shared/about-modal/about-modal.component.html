    <strong>How to use this app</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Do retros 'n' stuff</li>
      <li>Be nice</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>RAQ</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>How can I edit or delete an entry?</em> - Swipe it to the left!</li>
      <li>
        <em>How can I delete a board?</em> - At the moment you cannot, because that would make it too easy to
        accidentally lose all data (but your board is only accessible by link anyway).
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>How can I define action items?</em> - Not yet supported - but you can swipe an entry to the left to flag it!
      </li>
      <li><em>Why is the logo pink and low-res?</em> - Idk, we are not designers my dude</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Disclaimer</strong>
    <p>
      This is free open source software. The data you enter is stored on google cloud. Do not enter any sensitive
      information, because all boards are accessible and editable by anyone possessing the link. We use google analytics
      to track when you interact with this app, to which you agree by using this app. If you don't like that, we
      recommend installing a browser extension such as
      <a href="https://privacybadger.org/">Privacy Badger</a>
      (<em>hint: generally a good idea to install this one...</em>). If there are too many users and our costs go up too
      high, we reserve the right to temporarily restrict access to the app (until a cheaper solution or a sponsor is
      found).

    <strong>Donations</strong>
    <p>Not needed atm. Instead, be nice to someone today ðŸŒ¸</p>

      The code is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/patricsteiner/retronyx">github</a>. Pull-requests, feedback &
      feature-requests are welcome ðŸ¤— (although we are very restrictive with adding new features - this app ought to be
      as simple as possible).
