## Get Started

1. Install ionic `npm install -g @ionic/cli`
2. Install dependencies `npm install`
3. Run the app `ionic serve`

## Potential features

- Custom user color
- Action items (or make better use of the flags?)
- Add/remove cards
- Login/Permissions?
- Teams (i.e. board belongs to a team, requires login)
- I18N (currently only english is supported)

## Non-features (but still open for discussion)

- Comments. You should be discussing every entry. You can then still adjust it afterwards, if needed.
